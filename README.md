# MARKOUT

MARKOUT is a research-oriented Uniswap v4 hook that settles a provisional hook surcharge after observing a trade's post-execution markout.

Ordinary or inventory-improving flow receives a rebate. Flow that is followed by a favorable market move for the trader retains more of the surcharge for LP protection. Reactive Network is the autonomous observation and settlement layer: it watches hook and reference-market events, waits for the selected maturity horizon, and sends an authenticated callback to settle each trade.

## UHI10 alignment

- Primary UHI idea: **Fee-Rebate Systems tied to order-flow quality**
- Secondary idea: **Hybrid Routing between private orderflow and public Uniswap pools**
- Theme: **Sustainable Liquidity and MEV Protection**

## Research question

Can delayed, outcome-based fee settlement reduce LP adverse selection while charging benign traders less than a volatility-only dynamic-fee policy?

## MVP scope

- One ETH/USDC-style Uniswap v4 pool on Unichain Sepolia
- A fixed base LP fee plus a bounded provisional hook surcharge
- One deterministic markout horizon and one reference-market stream
- Reactive Network event subscriptions, maturity scheduling, and authenticated callbacks
- Pull-based trader rebates and an LP protection reserve
- A reproducible experiment comparing fixed fee, volatility fee, and MARKOUT

MARKOUT is an experimental hackathon prototype, not audited production software.
